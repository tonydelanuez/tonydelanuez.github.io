# Node Chatroom with Socket.IO

## Built by Tony De La Nuez and Greg York

This chat service contains a main lobby where users sign on with a nickname and can communicate with each other. Users may also create chat rooms for other to join, along with password protected rooms for private groups! Users can also be kicked by the creators of rooms and permanently banned.

Extra Features: 

Be in multiple chatrooms at once! Our design allows for the user to be in as many chatrooms as they wish, and can easily switch between them using the tabs mentioned below.

Manage your chatrooms with our interactive tabs! You can switch through your open chatrooms by clicking on the tabs located at the top of the chatbox and close one from your favorites by clicking the (X) button on the tab.

Integrated Instant Messaging! Our chat service has integrated instant messaging via prompts. Start a conversation with another user in your room by hitting "PM". Both parties will be prompted for messages (which will be sent back and forth) until either party hits "cancel" or enters an empty message.
