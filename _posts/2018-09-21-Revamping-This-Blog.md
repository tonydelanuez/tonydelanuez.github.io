# It's been a while. 
It's been approximately nine months since I posted anything to this blog. It was a packed nine months: 

* I finished up a crazy last semester at Washington University and graduated! 
* I took a trip to Japan where I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Hakone. 
* I moved back to California and started work at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) in San Francisco on the Bitbucket SRE team. It's been a blast so far. 

# What's next? 
I'm going to be writing more, and taking down most of the old material and projects that were on here prior to this post. Many of the projects were great learning experiences but I want to drive this blog more towards what life, and programming, is like as a software/site reliability engineer.
