# JavaScript Calendar

## Built by Tony De La Nuez and Greg York

Simple JavaScript calendar that allows users to add and remove events dynamically.

![Screenshot](https://tonydelanuez.com/assets/images/app-previews/calendarJS.png)

This app utilized AJAX with PHP server-side scripts that query the MySQL database to save and retrieve information, including user accounts and events.

We included functionality to search for a month and a year, or to jump to a day.

As user hovers over days, they glow to indicate interaction. On clicking a day, they're moved to the the event add form.

Attempted to implement user ability to email schedule (bug: emails sending but data is incorrect)
