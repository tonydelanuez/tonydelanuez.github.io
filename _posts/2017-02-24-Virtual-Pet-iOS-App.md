# Drawing iOS App 

This app utilizes MVC design and allows the user to play with and feed a virtual pet.

The layout is designed with proper constraints and works across all modern iOS devices in all orientations.

Five pets can be fed and played with and display their happiness/food values.

Each pet has a custom image and color which is switched whenever you press the button for a different pet.

The app alerts you when you've fed your pet too much or it doesn't have enough food to play.
