# GroupUP iOS App 

## - Built by Tony De La Nuez, Eric Goodman, and Justin Guyton

An iOS application (built in Swift 3) designed to help students at WUSTL create, find, and communicate with groups around them.

The app has tabs to navigate between a map, groups the user has joined, and a list of nearby groups. 
In the map tab, users are shown a scrollable map view where they can drop pins and start a meetup. 
To create a pin, the user long presses and a form to enter group details pops up. 

Each group has an associated chat where members of the group can message each other. We implemented chat using JSQMessages and Firebase.
