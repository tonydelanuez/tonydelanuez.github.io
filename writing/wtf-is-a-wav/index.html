<meta name=keywords content="tinkering"><meta name=description content="Today on a walk I started thinking about audio files, so I tried to reason through them from first principles.
The main question was &ldquo;wtf is in a sound file&rdquo;
Thinkin
On my walk, I recorded assumptions in my Notes app - partially using voice, typing when that failed.
I hadn&rsquo;t validated these, but they were the start of my train of thought.

Humans experience sound though vibrations transmitted through the ear drum and small bones in the ear, then to the cochlea, which vibrates little hairs that send electrical signals to the brain via the auditory nerve (I think? this is why cochlear implants are so effective - they&rsquo;re about as direct we can get to interacting with the brain)
To express sound, we probably need to express frequency, loudness, and &mldr; &ldquo;sound&rdquo;? Like.. whatever makes a violin playing a C note at the same volume sound different than a piano

(I later learned I was dancing around &ldquo;timbre&rdquo;)


In order to represent this data in a way that can be stored on a computer, we need to come up with a multi-dimensional representation that expresses a &mldr; frame? of sound. Frame is probably the wrong way to describe it, but a snapshot of the &ldquo;sound data&rdquo; at a specific point in time.
To &ldquo;replay&rdquo; the file, we need metadata that gives the player information about the sound - I assume one of the key pieces here is the rate at which we process frames? Unless that&rsquo;s standard across filetypes? I doubt we&rsquo;ve been able to standardize on a number but I believe this is sample rate and is expressed in Hertz

(bingo)


Similar to pictures or binaries, the metadata is probably represented as a byte sequence in the header / first few bytes of the file. I&rsquo;ve messed with hex editors before with games, I&rsquo;ll just look up the .wav or .mp3 header when I get home.

wav file


Based on reddit threads I remember from arguments about &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; music, I imagine &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; formats (.wav) just contain less rich data about the source sound than their FLAC counterparts. Either they&rsquo;re less expressive in the dimensionality of their frames and/or there are less frames per unit of time? Anyway, apparently without listening to lossless music I&rsquo;m not experiencing the full glory of Modest Mouse but instead drinking what must feel like a Lemon Lime La Croix to a margarita.

By printing the first 44 bytes, we can inspect the header and map from the documentation:\nwith open(\"voice.wav\", \"rb\") as f: header = f.read(44) for i in range(0, len(header), 4): chunk = header[i:i+4] print(f\"{i:02}: {chunk} – {int.from_bytes(chunk, 'little')}\") On the sample file, we see:\n00: b'RIFF' – 1179011410 04: b'$@\\x07\\x00' – 475172 08: b'WAVE' – 1163280727 12: b'fmt ' – 544501094 16: b'\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00' – 16 20: b'\\x01\\x00\\x01\\x00' – 65537 24: b'\\x80\\xbb\\x00\\x00' – 48000 28: b'\\x00w\\x01\\x00' – 96000 32: b'\\x02\\x00\\x10\\x00' – 1048578 36: b'data' – 1635017060 40: b'\\x00@\\x07\\x00' – 475136 So going through these and following the file header chart and teragon audio, we get the following information:\n1-4: The file is a RIFF file. 5-8: The file is 475180 bytes (this is stored as the size of the file - 8). 9-12: This is the WAVE file type header. --- format chunk --- 13-16: fmt chunk marker, start of the parameters explaining the waveform 17-20: (b'\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00') Format data is 16 bytes 21-22: (b'\\x01\\x00') PCM format 23-24: (b'\\x01\\x00') 1 channel (mono as opposed to stereo) 25-28: (b'\\x80\\xbb\\x00\\x00') 48000 sample rate (DAT) 29-32: (b'\\x00w\\x01\\x00') 96000 = (SampleRate * BitsPerSample * Channels) / 8 33-34: (b'\\x02\\x00') (BitsPerSample * Channels) / 8 = 2 35-36: (b'\\x10\\x00') 16 bits per sample (confirms above, 16 bits * 1 channel / 8 == 2) 37-40: (b'x02\\x00\\x10\\x00') Size of the data section is 1048578 bytes The wave library is how someone who respects their time would find this information, apparently.\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import wave with wave.open(\"voice.wav\", \"rb\") as w: print(\"Channels:\", w.getnchannels()) print(\"Sample width (bytes):\", w.getsampwidth()) print(\"Frame rate (Hz):\", w.getframerate()) print(\"Frame count:\", w.getnframes()) print(\"Compression:\", w.getcomptype(), w.getcompname()) frames = w.readframes(1024) raw_signal = np.frombuffer(frames, dtype=np.int16) plt.plot(raw_signal) plt.title(\"First 1024 samples of the voice track\") plt.xlabel(\"Sample\") plt.ylabel(\"Amplitude\") plt.show() Using wave to get the header information:\nChannels: 1 Sample width (bytes): 2 Frame rate (Hz): 48000 Frame count: 237568 Compression: NONE not compressed plotting the first 1024 frames\nTo be continued as I must sleep\n","wordCount":"793","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://tdoot.com/images/pictures/portrait.jpg","datePublished":"2025-07-17T22:18:21-05:00","dateModified":"2025-07-17T22:18:21-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tony"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tdoot.com/writing/wtf-is-a-wav/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tony De La Nuez","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tdoot.com/images/icons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tdoot.com/ accesskey=h title="tdoot (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tdoot.com/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=15>tdoot</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tdoot.com/categories/writing title=writing><span>writing</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tdoot.com/photos title=photos><span>photos</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tdoot.com/reading title=reading><span>reading</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tdoot.com/life title=life><span>life</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tdoot.com/tags title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tdoot.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tdoot.com/writing/></a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">(WIP) - WTF is a WAV</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-07-17 22:18:21 -0500 -0500'>July 17, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tony</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Today on a walk I started thinking about audio files, so I tried to reason through them from first principles.
