After listening to the "Man Enough" podcast episode on men's groups with John Wineland, picked up this book from one of the hosts. Surprisingly hadn't heard of her before but I'm halfway through and thoroughly enjoying it. Reading about these issues has been interesting and resonates with my experiences having been in hyper-masculine environments (college sports, paintball, etc). I'm glad there are books like this that support healthy discussions of men's issues for all of society to benefit.
