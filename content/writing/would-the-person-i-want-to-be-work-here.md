*This post expands on notes I shared with a mentee about navigating the job search.*

A job search isn’t *just* about landing an offer. It’s about choosing where you’ll spend 8+ hours a day, every weekday — and what you’ll get in return. When you’re thinking about switching roles, focus on three things: what you’ll be doing, who you’ll become, and what you’ll get in return.

# What matters?

Moving on, there are three key things that matter in each role:
1. What are you going to be doing day-to-day?
2. What are they going to pay you?
3. What are your future prospects?

Most things can be batched into one of these categories. I factor WLB, commute/remote work into 1 and 2, personal growth and development into 3.
For me, remote work is non-negotiable. I’ve done it for years and plan to keep it that way.

# Example - The Intern Trade

For interns, the decision is simpler. Most just want a “real job in tech” doing meaningful work, learning how companies ship software, and gaining enough experience to get hired again.  
Compensation is usually fixed. The real value is in what it unlocks: a return offer, a strong resume stamp, and real connections. I still run into people I interned with years ago (granted, I was basically a professional intern after six of them).  
If you’re choosing between offers, prioritize great mentors, interesting domains, and companies with names that open doors — either through brand or network.

# What I Optimize For Now

At this point in my career, I still care most about **what I’ll be doing** and **who I’m doing it with**. Compensation is a cutline. It has to clear the bar, but it’s not what makes the decision.

I care about my time. I don’t want to spend my days wading through bureaucracy, playing politics, or doing work that doesn’t stretch me. I want high-agency roles — ones that force me to build taste, intuition, and product sense.

That usually means what I find interesting (and will field from inbounds) are small, scrappy teams with more sphere of influence over the internet than they should have at their size; or high-growth orgs with strong technical cultures. Places where I can see how others work. Bonus points if I get to watch people **outside** of my function. I spend tons of time sharpening my skills in the areas that I work - I want a workplace that will show me how world-class designers and product managers think. 

I want to see leaders in action.
I want to understand customers.
I want to learn about (product) growth.
I want to learn to operate.
I want to have fun.

# Find the right org
I mostly agree with Jeff Atwood’s [take](https://blog.codinghorror.com/no-matter-what-they-tell-you-its-a-people-problem):

> _“The people you choose to work with are the most accurate predictor of job satisfaction I’ve ever found.”_

But I’ll add this: even great people can't thrive in a broken org. A happy team in an unhealthy org doesn’t stay happy for long. The culture sours. Morale drops due to operational load, bureaucracy, unpaid tech debt, or layoffs. People leave.

A good org can uplift teammates that you get along with but may not feel "connected" to. But even the best teammates can’t fix bad management, unclear direction, or perverse incentives.

So ask questions. How are managers evaluated? Have there been recent reorgs? Did teams go from unmanageable size to healthy ones — or the other way around?

# Who will this job turn me into?

Each time I take a new job, I (at least try to) carefully consider what it brings as a step in the path of both my career and my life. Most of my closest friends - who eventually became my neighbors, and will someday be the unofficial aunts and uncles of my kids - have some connection to Atlassian, the first company I worked at out of school.

My mentors span a few former employers.

One of my best friends works at Discord.

Every single job I've taken has shaped me either personally or professionally.
When I'm going through the interview loop and I interview with engineers on the team or in adjacent teams, I ask myself:

> “In the future, do I want to be like the people interviewing me?”

That question is one of my strongest filters. Stay somewhere long enough, and you’ll start to resemble the people around you, for better or worse. What does their career look like? What positions have they held? What have they built? What are they passionate about? Work backwards from there.

When I was at (pre-Elon) Twitter wondering how the hell to get out of there, I thought hard about who I wanted to be. I told my then-manager I wanted to be a top-tier systems engineer, a container security expert, and someone who worked on large-scale compute. Unfortunately, Twitter wasn't going to get me there.

When I was looking to leave, I started thinking of places where I'd heard of other obsessive nerds doing cool things and Discord came to mind.
They'd been my dream company since I was in graduate school; I'd read some of their blogs on systems engineering and knew it was a place with a high engineering bar and seemingly fun culture. 

The engineers at Discord were what I wanted to be. They were living the professional life that I wanted.

So I DMed someone I thought was an EM at Discord (on Slack, oddly enough) and asked if he knew who was hiring for Platform Security Engineers. He did - it was him. 
And he was the Director of Security. He ended up hiring me, and after I proved I could deliver results, let me grow in both depth and agency. With a great team supporting me and Kevin as my skip-level, I failed spectacularly at a bunch of things, had a few outsized wins, and ultimately became the engineer I set out to be when I left Twitter.

Discord ended up being a **fantastic** decision, twice.  
The people there were already living the kind of engineering life I wanted — and they helped me grow into it too.

Great jobs don’t just pay well (though that helps).
They shape who you become.

And for me, that all starts with one question:  
**Would the person I want to be work here?**
