<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>
<strong> Developer, security-focused. Reader of technical books and code, terrible at naming RPG characters. </strong>
<br />
</p>

<p>
When I was 12, I didn't have the money to play World of Warcraft so I taught myself to code, learned how to make a private server and connect it to the internet, then ran my own WoW server off of my mom's PC to play the game for free with my friends.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to today: I now spend my time learning everything I can about security and software development and hope to capture some of those thoughts here.

Currently I'm a software engineer at <a href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> where I work on the security of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>.
