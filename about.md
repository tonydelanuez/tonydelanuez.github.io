<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>
<strong> I have an intense passion for learning and a knack for problem solving that I use in order to write code that does cool things. </strong>
<br />
Ever since I was little, my love of computers has directed me towards a career path in computer science. When I was 12, I didn't have the money to play World of Warcraft so I decided to learn how to create a private server and run it off of my mom's desktop to emulate the game for myself.
<br />
This was my intro to web development, scripting, and databases.
I created and ran both a forum and website for my friends to register accounts on my server to play with me. I then taught myself how to create and compile scripts to generate the objects in the game and allow the emulated game to have similar functionality to the retail version.
<br />
Once school started back up, I hired some people from our forums to take care of community problems while I was in class. Ever since then, I've been hooked.
