        <p>
        I'm constantly working on projects or throwing myself into new hobbies.<br> I play a ton of video games, build computers, practice Jiu Jitsu, and do amateuer <a href="https://www.flickr.com/tonydelanuez">photography</a>.
        <br> Ever since I was little, my love of computers has directed me towards my path in Computer Science. When I was 12, I didn't have the money to play World of Warcraft so I decided to learn how to create a private server (sorry Blizzard!) off of my mom's desktop. This was my intro to web development as well, as I ran a site (Apache server) for my friends to register accounts on my server and send their account info to a mySQL database so they could log in and play with me. I taught myself how to create and compile scripts to generate the objects in the game and allow the emulated game to have similar functionality to the retail version. Once school started back up, I hired some people from our forums to take care of community problems while I was in class. Ever since then, I've been hooked.

 <h2>Projects</h2>
  <div id="ecg">
    <span class="projectTitle">Echocardiogram Design</span>
    <br>Washington University in St. Louis<br>
    <img width=250px src="img/agarsrc.png"/>
    <p> For the final project of a microelectronics class, my colleague Prakrit Srestha and I designed an amplifying circuit that would take the signal from electrodes places at different spots on the human body, and amplify it to a level easily viewable on a computer. The project was a lesson in circuit theory, common-mode voltage filtering, grounding, and proper usage of Wilson's central terminal. We were required to implement the above ideas and more in order to create a design with an acceptable amount of noise and a very clear, stable signal.

  <span class="projectTitle">Java Agar.io Clone</span>
  <br>Washington University in St. Louis<br>
  <img width=250px src="img/agarsrc.png"/>
  <p> To familiarize myself with Java (my prior background was in Python and MATLAB) I completed an online class offered by Washington University. For the final project I constructed an Agar.io clone, a game where you start with a small blob that follows your mouse and gets bigger as you "eat" different size food.
