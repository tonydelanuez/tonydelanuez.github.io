    <h2 id="about">HOW I GOT STARTED</h2>
  <p>
    I'm constantly working on projects or throwing myself into new hobbies.
I play a ton of video games, build computers, practice Jiu Jitsu, and do amateuer photography. 
Ever since I was little, my love of computers has directed me towards my path in Computer Science. When I was 12, I didn't have the money to play World of Warcraft so I decided to learn how to create a private server (sorry Blizzard!) off of my mom's desktop. This was my intro to web development as well, as I ran a site (Apache server) for my friends to register accounts on my server and send their account info to a mySQL database so they could log in and play with me. I taught myself how to create and compile scripts to generate the objects in the game and allow the emulated game to have similar functionality to the retail version. Once school started back up, I hired some people from our forums to take care of community problems while I was in class. Ever since then, I've been hooked.

  <br> 

  <p> At St. Mary's College of California I was in the Dual-Degree Engineering Program, where I studied for 3 years in liberal arts (heavily seminar and discussion based classes spanning from literature to sociology) and also took the physics and mathematical fundamentals for an engineering background. Also during my time at SMC I played on the Men's Rugby Team, earning a USA Rugby D1A College National Runner-Up title my freshman year and back to back USA Rugby D1 College National Champion titles my sophomore and junior years. </p>

  <p>
  At Washington University I am currently working on both a BS and MS in computer science (with a completed minor in electrical engineering).

    <br>
    <img width=350px src="img/fitbitDemo.png" alt="Arduino Fitbit Clone"/><br>
    <br>
    <p>
    For a class project I created a Fitbit clone with step tracking, temperature detection, a sleep tracking mode, and live graphing of the accelerometer data through a Java GUI. This was also a lesson in protocols as I created a custom communication protocol to send messages and data from the Arduino to the Java program used for calculations and display output. I used a Sparkfun board DEV-12757 and the SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer (MMA8452Q) for the tracker. In order to effectively track step data and filter out noise from the accelerometer, I computed a rolling average of the input data and created both peak-detecting and threshold-matching algorithms to detect what was actually a full step. In the picture above, the green dots are the peaks at where a step was detected. Once 45 seconds passes, the x-axis adjusts and starts at 45(this increments every 45 seconds). The pedometer can be reset, and when the device is set to sleep tracking mode it will continue to count time spent under a certain threshold of movement (I allowed a certain amount of movement to account for tossing and turning in sleep). The device also displays a dynamic step rate, calculated using the time since last reset of the pedometer. Modes are indicated both in hardware by two LEDs and in software via the GUI. I did not create housing for the device, this was all set up on a breadboard. Code not publicly available for academic integrity.

  <p> To familiarize myself with Java (my prior background was in Python and MATLAB) I completed an online class offered by Washington University. For the final project I constructed an Agar.io clone, a game where you start with a small blob that follows your mouse and gets bigger as you "eat" different size food.

    <br>
    <p> For the final project of a microelectronics class, my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakrit"> Prakrit Shrestha </a> and I designed an amplifying circuit that would take the signal from electrodes placed at different spots on the human body, and amplify it to a level easily viewable on a computer. The project was a lesson in circuit theory, common-mode voltage filtering, grounding, and proper usage of Wilson's central terminal. We were required to implement the above ideas and more in order to create a design with an acceptable amount of noise and a very clear, stable signal.
