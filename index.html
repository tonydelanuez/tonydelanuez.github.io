        I'm constantly working on projects or throwing myself into new hobbies.<br> I play a ton of video games, build computers, practice Jiu Jitsu, and do amateuer <a href="https://www.flickr.com/tonydelanuez">photography</a>.
        <br> Ever since I was little, my love of computers has directed me towards my path in Computer Science. When I was 12, I didn't have the money to play World of Warcraft so I decided to learn how to create a private server (sorry Blizzard!) off of my mom's desktop. This was my intro to web development as well, as I ran a site (Apache server) for my friends to register accounts on my server and send their account info to a SQL database so they could log in and play with me. I taught myself how to create and compile scripts to generate the objects in the game and allow the emulated game to have similar functionality to the retail version. Once school started back up, I hired some people from our forums to take care of community problems while I was in class. Ever since then, I've been hooked.
