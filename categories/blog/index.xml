      <description>In the last post, I explained the utility and purpose of Kubernetes Controllers. This post will explain how to build them, and how to think about designing them. We&amp;rsquo;ll go into Controller patterns, anti-patterns, and sharp edges of the model that you&amp;rsquo;re bound to run into.
controller-runtime - use it. Or don&amp;rsquo;t, I don&amp;rsquo;t care. It&amp;rsquo;ll probably help though.
You can absolutely build a controller from scratch using client-go (and sometimes that makes sense), but most of the time you should just get started with controller-runtime.</description>

      <description>Controllers aren&amp;rsquo;t just add-ons to Kubernetes - they&amp;rsquo;re fundamental to how the whole system works. They&amp;rsquo;re the caretakers of your cluster, overseeing and orchestrating processes to ensure your defined resources stay on track. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s maintaining pod replicas, managing rolling updates, or handling node lifecycles, controllers are there making sure things run smoothly.
The Kubernetes documentation explains their job as follows:
In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of yourÂ cluster, then make or request changes where needed.</description>

      <title>building a home gym</title>

      <description>Recently a friend asked for my recommendations for home gym equipment as they wanted to start building out theirs. Little do they know I&amp;rsquo;ve spent way too many hours thinking about this. My home gym is nothing special but it keeps me healthy, out of commercial gyms, and never leaves me wishing I had more equipment. I like to think that&amp;rsquo;s due to making the right choices on how to fill it.</description>

      <description>Back in grad school I used to make some extra cash by coaching and writing articles about Hearthstone (an online collectible card game made by Blizzard). I primarily wrote &amp;ldquo;deck techs&amp;rdquo;, guides that explained how to play the most powerful and consistent decks that were dominating the scene. I loved this job, it was a surprisingly technical creative outlet and paid for the occasional treat meals at my favorite restaurant in St.</description>

      <title>doing k8s on the cheap - my &#34;new&#34; homelab</title>

      <description>Most SRE-aligned engineers will tell you they have a home lab. Depending on how grey the beard is, it may be an old blade they acquired when a company moved data centers, an intricate setup of Raspberry Pi 4s set up in a custom cooling rack, or like me and many others, it may just be an old gaming computer they no longer use but cannot bring themselves to get rid of.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a system (sigh) built on getting people to buy things they can&amp;rsquo;t reasonably afford through the veil of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s only X a month.&amp;rdquo; Unnecessary consumer debt sets people up to fail by putting them on a treadmill of excess consumption they believe is under control.
Sticker shock is a good thing. If you see the price tag of something and it has your head reeling, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a good reason you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be buying it.</description>
